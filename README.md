# Algorithm and Data Structure Project
##### Overview

Welcome to my Algorithm and Data Structure Project! This project is a personal collection of various algorithms and data structures implemented in Python. It serves as a study resource and a showcase of my skills in designing and implementing efficient and optimized solutions to common problems in computer science.
Features

- **Algorithms**: Implementations of common algorithms including sorting, searching, graph traversal, and dynamic programming.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and graphs.
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for each algorithm and data structure to ensure correctness and reliability.
